A/C 1: Create a web page in React/Node that uses a database to store test score results for a class of 5 students. MySQL is preferred.
A/C 2: The left column of the webpage should display the names of all 5 students.
A/C 3: The right column contains input fields that displays the current test score values from the database for each student.
A/C 4: The right column input fields allow the user (Teacher) to over-ride the current test score in the database.
A/C 5: Below the left column is a row labeled “Average Score”, that presents the average of the scores for the 5 students without server involvement.
A/C 6: The web page is web accessible.
A/C 7: The web page uses responsive design techniques. (We use Material UI but you are welcome to use any design system / roll your own if you like.)
